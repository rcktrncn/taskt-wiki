# Welcome to the taskt wiki!

taskt (formerly sharpRPA) is the first truly free, easy to use, and open source process automation client built on the .NET Framework in C#. taskt allows you to build a digital workforce and automate straight-forward and repetative actions with ease. Included is a "what you see is what you get" designer with dozens of automation commands and options as well as a screen recorder that records and replays scripted automation. With taskt, you can spend less time writing code and more time building functionality.
