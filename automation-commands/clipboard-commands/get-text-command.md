### When would I use this command
Use this command when you have copied text or an object to the clipboard and would like to retain the data in the clipboard for further use.  You can apply the value of the clipboard against a variable and reference that variable later so you can perform actions using the copied text.

### Command Parameters:
**Please select a variable to select Clipboard contents:** Select a variable which will contain the value of the clipboard text.  If you have 'Create Missing Variables During Execution' enabled, you can simply type the name of the variable and it will be created during the task execution.
