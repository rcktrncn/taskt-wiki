## What does this command do?
This command allows you to apply formatting to a string


## When would I want to use this command?
Use this command when you have a date or number (either free text or in a variable) that is required to be in a specific format. For example, you may want a date without the time 8/6/17 instead of 8/6/17 12:34:52PM. You may also want to add decimal places to a number, convert a number into a percentage, or convert a number into currency.
